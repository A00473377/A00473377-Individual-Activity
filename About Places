A#: A00473377

Hi all,
The below mentioned two places are one of the most beautiful ones I ever visited in my life:
	1. Kodaikanal, Ooty Hillstations
Situated in the northen part of India, these hill stations are a marvel of nature.
	2. Hyderabad Ramoji Film City
one of the backbones of major hindi films, this place has beautiful sets and structures. I got to see the various sets for hindi films in person, and majorly the vibe was amazing. The parade at the end of day made me feel so nice that I recommend to people atleast visit once.
